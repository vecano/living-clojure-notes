Simple Values
=============

integers
decimals
ratios (get evaluated until we need to)
  * they get reduced 4/2 -> 2, 6/4 -> 3/2
  * only integers: 4.0/2 gives https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/LispReader.java#L330
    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NumberFormatException.html
strings
  * quotes
characters
  * backslash
keywords
  * colons
booleans
  * `true` or `false`
nil
  * absence of value


Expressions
===========

    (/ 1 3)

  * parens
  * operator (or function) first


Nested
------

    (+ 1 (+ 8 3))


Collections
===========

  * immutable
  * persistent (are smart by using structural sharing)


### Functions

https://clojuredocs.org/ or http://clojure.org/cheatsheet or `(doc cons)`

Examples:

  * `first` https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first
    * returns `nil` instead of out of range exception
  * `last` is slow for lists, why?
  * `rest` https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/rest
  * `cons` adds as first element (construct?)
  * `conj[oin]` adds element but position depends on type
  * `count`


Lists
-----

  * ordered
  * '() or (list)
  * mixed types
  * separate with commas or spaces (more idiomatic, commas are ignored)


Vectors
-------

  * [ and ]
  * (fast) indexed


### Functions

  * `nth`


Maps
----

  * { }
  * keys and values
  * known as dictionaries or hashes in other languages
  * commas are optional but more idiomatic with maps
  * keywords are most common type for keys


### Functions

  * `get`
    * optional default value
    * returns nil when missing
  * use key as a function (when using keywords), more idiomatic
  * `keys`
  * `vals`
  * `assoc`
  * `dissoc`
  * `merge`


Sets
----

  * `#{}`
  * unique elements

### Functions

  * prepend with `clojure.set`
  * `clojure.set/union`
  * `clojure.set/difference`
  * `clojure.set/intersection`
  * `set` to turn other collections into sets
  * `get`
  * `contains`
  * `conj`
  * `disj`
  * use element as a function
  * use set as a function


Symbols
=======

  * `def` to create global vars which are like variables in other languages but cannot be changed
  * `let` to create temporary bindings within a context: use [] with pairs of symbols and values


Functions
=========

  * `defn` creates vars for functions
  * (defn <name> [<parameters...>] <body>)
  * `fn` anonymous function. `defn` => `def` + `fn`
    * `(fn [] <body>)` can also be: `(#(<body>))`
    * `(#(<body>))` form can take one parameter with `%`: `(#(<body> %) <parameter>)` or multiple with `%1`, `%2`, ...


Namespaces
==========

  * `ns`
  * `*ns*` find namespace
  * auto-required namespaces on REPL start: clojure.core, clojure.set, etc.
  * https://blog.8thlight.com/colin-jones/2010/12/05/clojure-libs-and-namespaces-require-use-import-and-ns.html
  * `require`
    * `(require 'clojure.set)`
    * `(require '[foo.var :as fv])`
    * `(require '[foo.var :refer :all])`
    * use within `ns`:


```clojure
(ns wonderland
  (:require [alice.favfoods :as af]))
```

Summary
=======

  * Lists are for collections of data that you want to access from the top of the list.
  * Vectors are for collections of data that you want to access anywhere by position.
  * Maps are for key-value pairs, which is great for organizing data and having easy access.
  * Sets are for collections of unique elements; by grouping elements together in a set, you can perform set operations on them.
  * Functions
  * Immutable collections
  * Code is data! All Clojure code is made of lists of data.
