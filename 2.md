Logic
=====

  - `true?`
  - `false?`
  - `nil?` (false and nil are the only logically false values)
  - `not`
  - `=`
    - collection equality
  - `not=` shortcut for (not (= ...))


Collections
-----------

  - `empty?`
  - `seq`
    - `(seq [])` is more idiomatic than `(not (empty? x))`
  - `every?` example (with predicate): `(every? odd? [1 3 5])`
  - `not-any?`
  - `some`


### `seq`

Collections and sequences abstractions.

Collections are persistent and immutable data structures that implement the clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection interface.

A sequence is a walkable list abstraction for the collection data structure.

Functions like `first` call `seq` under the covers.


Flow Control
============

  - `if`
  - `if-let`
  - `when`
  - `when-let`
  - `cond` short-circuited. It is similar to `elseif` in other languages
    - we can use a default clause at the end
  - `case` for testing just one value
    - we can use a default clause at the end


Functions
=========

  - `partial` multiple-argument function -> chain of single argument functions
  - `comp` combines functions right to left


Destructuring
=============

Bind elements in vectors and maps. Handles nesting.

  - `:as` to keep initial data structure
  - `:or` use with dictionaries to assign default values
  - `:keys` to bind to same names as keys
  - use on `defn` to bind and document parameter structure


Laziness
========

Infinite lists!?!?!

  - `take`
  - `range`
  - `repeat` returns a value over and over
  - `repeatedly` repeatedly executes a function
  - `cycle`


Recursion
=========

  - `loop`
  - `recur` always use for recursive functions


Data Transformations
====================

"shaping data"

Higher level abstractions build upon recursion:

  - `map`
    - returns same shape
    - same number of elements going out as coming in
    - can take more than one collection (terminates on shortest collection)
  - `reduce`
    - can change the shape
    - cannot reduce infinite sequence
  - `filter`
  - `remove`
  - `for` can take multiple collections
    - `:let` modifier
    - `:when` modifier
