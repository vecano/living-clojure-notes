Logic
=====

  - `true?`
  - `false?`
  - `nil?` (false and nil are the only logically false values)
  - `not`
  - `=`
    - collection equality
  - `not=` shortcut for (not (= ...))


Collections
-----------

  - `empty?`
  - `seq`
    - `(seq [])` is more idiomatic than `(not (empty? x))`
  - `every?` example (with predicate): `(every? odd? [1 3 5])`
  - `not-any?`
  - `some`


### `seq`

Collections and sequences abstractions.

Collections are persistent and immutable data structures that implement the clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection interface.

A sequence is a walkable list abstraction for the collection data structure.

Functions like `first` call `seq` under the covers.


Flow Control
============

  - `if`
  - `if-let`
  - `when`
  - `when-let`
  - `cond` short-circuited. It is similar to `elseif` in other languages
    - we can use a default clause at the end
  - `case` for testing just one value
    - we can use a default clause at the end


Functions
=========

  - `partial`


Destructuring
